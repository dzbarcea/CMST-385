                            Earlier this month, the singer, rapper, songwriter, and YouTuber known as Quadeca announced
                            his
                            “SCRAPYARD SERIES,” wherein he’ll release five two-song collections, or packs, over the span
                            of a few
                            months—one every two or three weeks. Each song associated with this project will supposedly
                            represent a
                            different style, and yesterday brought the first pack, aptly titled SCRAPYARD I. The leadoff
                            song,
                            “A LA CARTE,” a collaboration with the electronic artist brakence, debuted inside the Top 50
                            of the
                            Genius Top Songs chart.

                            Around three years ago, a teen pop artist from Ohio named brakence started to experience a
                            relentless, nagging headache that lasted for months. This chronic pain, and brakence's
                            broader understandings of his mind, body and environment, inspired his second album, the
                            meticulous hypochondriac, released in December 2022 on Columbia Records.

                            Raised in the suburbs of Columbus, brakence enjoyed a comfortable middle class upbringing
                            that
                            allowed him to explore his creative tendencies from an early age. He developed his voice in
                            choir and his knowledge of music theory in jazz piano lessons. He attended an alternative
                            middle
                            school that abolished grades and sent him on "discovery days" to a family friend's basement
                            studio to record. Around that time, he sunk deeper into the internet and grew obsessed with
                            maximal, early 2010s dubstep.
